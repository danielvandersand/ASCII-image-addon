# ASCII-image-addon

You will need to run python -m http.server and paste in http://[::]:8000/ to your browser to get this to run possibly.

Not completely sure why creating a localhost works to run this, but that's ok. To use this, just upload a jpg, jpeg, or png file and it will return that file in ASCII format.
